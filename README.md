# DBC Phase 3 Passion Project: AngularJS

### How It Works
These two simple todo lists are nearly identical in functionality, and they are made functional using the frontend framework AngularJS. One is written in a single HTML file. One is separated out into a controller and a view to work with modular MVC architecture. A user can see all tasks in the list, add a task to the list, and remove a task from the list once it has been completed. Neither list persists when the browser is closed out or refreshed, but the static HTML pages are dynamically updated in real time thanks to Angular's scope object and two way data binding.


### How to Contribute to It
If you would like to contribute to my exploration of AngularJS, please feel free to send project ideas and tutorials my way. I would like to continue learning how to build web apps in JavaScript by jumping into Node, Express, and Mongo.


### How to Clone the Repo and Get it Working in Development
If you clone the repo to your local computer and want to play with the code I've written, you will be well on your way as long as you keep the files in their respective directories and open the index.html file with your browser. I developed each app to work in Chrome.

The tutorials I followed to create these apps, as well as other resources used to help me build a foundation on this fantastic JavaScript framework, can be found in [screencast/resources.md](https://github.com/davidbison/todos-in-angular/tree/master/screencast). The script tag included in each app is the minified source from [AngularJS v1.4.7](https://code.angularjs.org/1.4.7/angular.min.js). Unless something strange happens to this version of Angular, you should be up and running without a hitch.
