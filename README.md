# New Technology Study: Single Page and MVC To Do Lists Using AngularJS

## How It Works
These two simple todo lists are nearly identical in functionality, and they are made functional using the frontend framework AngularJS. One is written in a single HTML file. One is separated out into a controller and a view to work with modular MVC architecture. A user can see all tasks in the list, add a task to the list, and remove a task from the list once it has been completed. Neither list persists when the browser is closed out or refreshed, but the static HTML pages are dynamically updated in real time thanks to Angular's scope object and two way data binding.


## How to Contribute to It
If you would like to contribute to my exploration of AngularJS, please feel free to send project ideas and tutorials my way. I would like to continue my exploration of writing JavaScript web apps by jumping into Node, Express, and Mongo.


## How to Clone the Repo and Get it Working in Development
If you would like to clone the repo to see the lists, you will have to do little more than keep the files in their respective directories and simply open the index.html files in your browser. I developed these apps to work in Chrome following tutorials, which I have included in a separate file in the Notes directory of this repo.
