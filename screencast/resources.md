# AngularJS Resources

As an abstract random thinker, my learning style leans toward tangible and interactive activities. Coming into the technology with a dim idea of what I could do, I started learning about AngularJS with several tutorials. Once I had those done, I watched several videos to get an understanding of where Angular fits in with tech today, how it's received, what it was intended to do, and why it's so powerful. Finally, I moved into the documentation to see how they read, what they offer, and how accessible the information is at a glance.

I was lucky in that most of the resources I stumbled upon were helpful, and I've included the onces I learned something from below. They are separated by category in case you have a preference in yoru own learning style. If you know of a good resources not on this list, please feel free to share it by making an issue request through Github.
